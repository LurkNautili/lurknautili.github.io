# Things I do in my free time

## Programming:

### [Perlin Noise Experimentation](/projects/misc/perlin_noise/perlin_noise.html)
I was messing around with implementing a Perlin noise generator based on the 
page on Wikipedia, and what I ended up with does work but could be improved upon.

### [.cube LUT generator tool](/projects/tools/cube_lut/generator.html)
Couldn't figure out a way to override the colors on Twitch Studio's follower goal 
widget easily (it's loaded as a web page from an origin I don't control) but the app 
supports applying color filters in the form of .cube LUTs so I wrote this to try 
working around that limitation. It's a bit janky but technically does the job. 

### [Unfinished Game Jam Game](/projects/games/gmtk_only_one_jam/game.html)
I started working on a game for an earlier GMTK game jam but got lost on the way. 
Another instance where I got more interested in re-implementing e.g. Box2D, rather 
than actually working on finishing a game for once. 
But so long as it's fun I suppose it doesn't matter.

### [SS13 (Paradise) Telescience Calculator](/projects/tools/ss13_paradise_telescience_calculator/telesci_calc.html)
Wrote this when I was playing Space Station 13 on this particular server, and 
got annoyed with how difficult it was to calculate teleport trajectories with the 
calibration and everything. There are some bugs still but I don't play there anymore, 
and they more or less removed the teleporter anyway.

## Game Jamming:

### [Wrath of the JarHand](https://lurknautili.itch.io/wrath-of-the-jarhand)
Finally decided to properly participate in one of these jams, after many 
false starts on previous occasions. I have a tendency to start writing engines 
instead of actually working on a game, but this time around I forced myself to 
find a team and work within an existing engine, Unreal. I had already used UE4 at 
so this was a pretty chill experience, although I did kind of run out of time in the end.

## Graphics:
I dabble in graphics too from time to time, but it hasn't been a focus in quite a while now. 
I'll link some examples of earlier work here anyway, though.
