# About me
I'm a (at the time of writing) 29-year-old software developer, mostly using C++ and JS.

I've also learned to use UE4 in the past couple of years. It was painful at first but,  
now I think I've learned to appreciate the engine despite its idiosyncrasies.
 
I'm building this site as a place to showcase projects and hopefully give me additional reasons  
to start and actually finish them. Maybe it'll help hold me accountable to goals I set myself.

On top of just programming I also have some experience with graphics, having used Blender since  
about version 2.3, albeit somewhat infrequently. I tend to collect Blender trivia more than actually  
use the damn thing. There are a couple of examples of that on my [Projects](/projects/) page, though.

Of course, I also have pretty good general IT skills, like Linux and Windows environments,  
game servers, web servers (mostly Node.js but now nginx as well), DNS, etc.

I'm a big fan of science fiction. The Expanse is amazing, and my favorite book series is probably  
the Culture series by Iain M. Banks, although Peter F. Hamilton and some others are also in the running.

# About this site
This is a GitHub Pages site, built using Jekyll. It's my first time using this tech,  
and basically the first home page I've ever bothered building. Hopefully it's not too ugly.  

The source code for everything is on the [github.io repository](https://github.com/LurkNautili/lurknautili.github.io) corresponding to this page  
and I've arranged it such that everything in that repository (I hosted images and other  
such things elsewhere) is free to use, modify and redistribute in whatever way you wish.  
The parts that I've written, anyway. There are some files Jekyll needs that aren't mine,  
related to this site's infrastructure and so on. Everything in /projects/ is entirely  
my work and free to use though. 

If you have feedback you can [contact me](/contact.html) and I'll see what I can do.

To-do: adding some sort of simple form that submits to some service listening on my server.

Also to-do: fixing the style on this site such that it looks nice on mobile, and this  
left-justified-but-centered-paragraph look is probably not easy on the eyes, so I guess  
I'll have to read an actual book on web design or something to sort out this mess...

(But hey it's got rounded corners like W11 so it's definitely all modern and stuff, right?)
