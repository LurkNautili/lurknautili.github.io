# About me
I'm a (at the time of writing) 29-year-old software developer, mostly using C++ and JS.

I've also learned to use UE4 in the past couple of years. It was painful at first but,  
now I think I've learned to appreciate the engine despite its idiosyncrasies.
 
I'm building this site as a place to showcase projects and hopefully give me additional reasons  
to start and actually finish them. Maybe it'll help hold me accountable to goals I set myself.

On top of just programming I also have some experience with graphics, having used Blender since  
about version 2.3, albeit somewhat infrequently. I tend to collect Blender trivia more than actually  
use the damn thing. There are a couple of examples of that on my [Projects](/projects/) page, though.

Of course, I also have pretty good general IT skills, like Linux and Windows environments,  
game servers, web servers (mostly Node.js but now nginx as well), DNS, etc.

I'm a big fan of science fiction. The Expanse is amazing, and my favorite book series is probably  
the Culture series by Iain M. Banks, although Peter F. Hamilton and some others are also in the running.

# About this site
This is a GitHub Pages site, built using Jekyll. It's my first time using this tech,  
and basically the first home page I've ever bothered building. Hopefully it's not too ugly.  


If you have feedback you can [contact me](/contact.html) and I'll see what I can do.


To-do: adding some sort of simple form that submits to some service listening on my server.
