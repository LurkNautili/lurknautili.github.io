# Welcome to LurkNautili's home page!
This is my portfolio / home page / collection of curiosities.  
Inevitably different parts will fall out of sync with one another,  
but at the time of writing this (September 2021), this is the very  
first version of the site and many things are bound to change.

I may use this "Welcome" page as a "News" page in the future, very  
much still figuring things out currently...

Pretty new to making public-facing web pages, so bear with me here.
